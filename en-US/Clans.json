If one of the judges tastes the blood of another Cainite, it is very difficult for him to stop. If at least one level of hunger is satisfied with vampiric vit√¶, this causes a trial against Hunger Frenzy (see Basic Rulebook p. 220) against a difficulty of 2 + severity of the curse. If the trial fails, Haqim's child tries to feast on the vampire's blood, sometimes until it diablerizes its blood-related victim. This causes many problems, as the Banu Haqim have joined the Camarilla, who tend to view the Amaranth as anathema.",

These traits last for another night, like a hangover after a night of drinking. Each of these traits lowers an attribute by 1 point, though the storyteller may decide that a forked tongue or a bearish musky smell reduce Charisma, whereas bat-like ears lower Determination (\"all those annoying noises\"). If you can't think of anything immediately, the trait lowers Intelligence or Manipulation. The number of traits that manifest on a Gangrel is equal to his severity of the curse. When your character rides the wave of his fury (see p. 219), you can choose only one trait to manifest, which causes you to suffer a penalty to only one of your attributes.",

Many Lasombra have servants to handle the technology for them, but a few strange beasts can manage without them.

If the roll fails, the blood relative simply continues to drink, to the point where he may need to be physically dissuaded. If a salubri passes on the embrace, the third eye of the bloodline that Saulot opened on one of his many journeys is also passed on. This third eye is not always clearly of human origin. Rumors persist of vertical, serpentine pupils or even worm-like dot eyes. While this third eye can be physically concealed, such as with a headscarf or hood, it is always present and cannot be disguised by any supernatural force. Every time a salubri activates the power of a discipline, the third eye weeps out Vit√¶. The intensity is proportional to the level of the discipline used and ranges from trickling to streaming.

However, even followers of the Ashcan School never perceive normal streets as immaculately beautiful.
