What at first appears to be the ultimate power of foresight and vision, perhaps bestows too much knowledge upon its users. They may be able to detect an assassin's blade before it strikes or enter an enemy's mind to turn it upside down, but they also sense every emotion, good and bad, see things they would prefer not to see, and discern a future they would rather not take a closer look at. Those who use Auspex open the door to paranoia, but using it is addictive. Once you know that the truth is within your grasp, you will seize any opportunity to reveal it. Kindred use Auspex in many ways. Some vampires act as spies for their court or faction. Others act on their own, blackmailing mortals or immortals with the secrets they have gleaned from quiet conversations, subtle sentients, and telepathic intrusions. Auspex allows the user to assume the role of detective in their own domain, investigating the scene of a vampire's destruction for telltale spiritual clues or interrogating suspects with supernatural accuracy.",

Kindred with Oblivion's Sight, Heightened Senses, or Eyes of the Beast may activate that ability to allow themselves to see while in the oubliette. The victim can attempt to escape by climbing the walls of the oubliette, although this requires a Resolve + Occult (or Oblivion, or Blood Sorcery) test at Difficulty 8 rather than any test of physical merits. If they win, they emerge out of the shadows where they entered; the same happens when the power ends, potentially jettisoning the victim into direct sunlight.While in the oubliette, the victim does not age or require sleep or sustenance, but may suffer mental trauma (Storyteller discretion).",
